We are just college students developing it on our free time as a hobby. We assure you we aren't being lazy; it's just really hard and time-consuming.\n\n*For the time being, if Geode is crashing for you, uninstall it.* We will be letting everyone know when it's updated to the latest GD version.\n\nIf you want to install Geode for an older version of GD, you can still find older versions on our [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/geode-sdk/geode/releases).",
