                "question": "I can't see the Geode button!",
                "answer": "First of all, make sure you have the latest version of *Geometry Dash* and *Geode*. Then, check if Geode has installed properly. \n\nOn Windows, go to your *Geometry Dash folder*, and check if the following files exist: *Geode.dll*, *GeodeUninstaller.exe*, *the geode folder*, *xinput1_4.dll*. You can also check if your *antivirus* has quarantined Geode itself. Don't worry, this is a *false positive*, and you can add an exception for the detected file. \n\nFor Android, make sure you also have the latest version of *the launcher*. \n\nIf you are trying to install Geode on *Linux*, [go here](#i-am-installing-geode-on-linux-what-do-i-have-to-do). \n\nIf all else fails, you can join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/9e43WMKzhp) and open a new help thread."

                "question": "I am installing Geode on Linux. What do I have to do?",
                "answer": "Geode is not available by default on Linux. However, we can run it easily using [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/), a compatibility layer. Make sure you have it installed, then open the **Windows** version of the installer with Wine. Your root filesystem will appear as the *Z* disk in the installer. Flatpak users: if the installer is unable to locate your game files, open the gameâ€™s local files in `~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Geometry Dash/`. Then, rename the original GeometryDash.exe to something like GeometryDashReal.exe and place the Geode installer (`.exe`) in this directory and rename it to `GeometryDash.exe`. Launch the game through Steam, and installer should run automatically and install Geode. Finally, rename: GeometryDash.exe to geode.exe and GeometryDashReal.exe to GeometryDash.exe. \n\nAfter installation, Geode on Linux requires one **very important** extra step to function correctly. You need to set *DLL overrides* for Wine to allow Geode to load properly.\n\nIn Steam, right click on *Geometry Dash*, click on *Properties*, and inside *Launch Options* enter the following: `WINEDLLOVERRIDES=\"xinput1_4=n,b\" %command%`. \n\n If you are launching Geometry Dash in another way than Steam, then you have to find a way to set *DLL overrides* for your method."
