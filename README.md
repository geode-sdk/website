# GeodeSDK website
The source code for the GeodeSDK website.

## Developing

To spin up a local version of the site, you first need to install all the dependencies. This is easily done by running:

```bash
npm i
```

Once the dependencies are done, you can now run:

```bash
npm run watch
```

to start a server that watches for changes in the script.

## Building

> Note: If you are just opening a PR for a change to the site, you don't need to worry about building the site.

First, make sure to install the dependencies (steps above). Then run `npm run build` to build the site.
